# Terraform File for Snowflake and GCP

Terraform file used to create the Snowflake and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure for a [pipeline I built in Airflow](https://github.com/jackmulligan-ire/airflow-snowflake-pipeline)!

The repo makes use of a `variables.tf` file locally. I've kept this out of GitHub to protect the private key for connecting to Snowflake!
